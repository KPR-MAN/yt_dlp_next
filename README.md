# Meet YT DLP Next – The Python YouTube DLP Wrapper  

YT DLP Next is a **modern, clean, and lightweight graphical user interface (GUI)** for [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).  
I built it to make downloading videos and audio easier, without needing to type complex command-line options.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🎥 Download **video** or **audio** with a single click  
- 🎚 Select **quality** and **format** (mp4, mp3, etc.)  
- 🌍 Subtitle support with language selection  
- 🖼 Optional download of thumbnails and metadata  
- 📂 Clean file naming and customizable output folder  
- 🖤 Minimal, modern, and user-friendly design  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
1. Install ffmpeg (If using the executeable without installing python).  
2. Download the latest release of YT DLP Next and Extract it.  
3. Run the executable `YT DLP Next.exe`  (or `python main.py` if using the source).  
4. Paste your video/playlist/channel URL and hit **Download**.
